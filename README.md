  ## About
  The Fitness Tracker is an application built to track a user's workouts.  Users can create and track multiple workouts completed on a given day.  Users can also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.  Additionally, if the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user can track the distance travelled. This application utilizes a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express.
